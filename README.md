# Solar system model

A simplified model of the Moon, Earth and Sun using OpenGL for computer graphics course at IP Paris.

The project included following steps:

- generating a sphere mesh
- implementing Phong lighting model
- generating three spheres and their animation:
    - Earth rotates around the Sun
    - Earth rotates around its axis but axis is tilted
    - the Moon rotates around Earth
    - the Moon rotates around its axis facing Earth always with the same side
- mapping textures to the planets
